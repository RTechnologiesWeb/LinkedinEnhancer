              The Skills section is crucial for LinkedIn's algorithm. It's how employers find suitable candidates. Avoid listing too many skills (max 50), focus on relevant ones, and arrange them by importance. For career changers, highlight transferable skills.  Include both hard and soft skills. Get endorsements to boost credibility. Ask connections for endorsements using a personalized message, highlighting shared experiences.

              Would you ever buy something on Amazon with zero reviews? Heck no! Same goes for your LinkedIn profile - you need that social proof.
              Imagine you're a hiring manager looking at two candidate profiles. One has 15 glowing recommendations raving about this personâ€™s skills and accomplishments. The other has 1 or 2 generic recommendations, or maybe even zero. Which one are you going to be more impressed by and call in for an interview? The choice is obvious!
              So get out there and leverage your network to snag some top-notch recommendations. Focus on glowing endorsements from past bosses, coworkers, or clients who can really sing your praises. Make sure they're concrete, quantitative, and tailored to your goals. Don't be shy - a little friendly follow-up can work wonders. Quite possibly, your next job may depend on it.

              Leverage your education section to tell your professional story. Showcase your education strategically, prioritizing the most recent and relevant degrees. Include details like major, coursework, projects, and honors. Use the description to highlight skills and knowledge gained.
              List all relevant qualifications, even if some are not directly related to your current career goals. Always list your highest qualification as it showcases your academic level. Strategically include keywords in descriptions to enhance your profile's searchability. 
              
              Highlight skills and knowledge acquired during your studies that are relevant to your desired career path. Include all higher education experiences, even if they aren't directly related, but omit high school details. For older degrees consider omitting the year of graduation: This can help prevent unconscious age bias.
